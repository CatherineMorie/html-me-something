		<p>Growing up for everyone is a challenge. A journey. Thanks to my mother, I was instilled with the mindset of placing value on the small things in life. 
		  Now, this may have been because we didn't have the money for much more than that (no Sega Genesis in my house!), but I am grateful for the view on life I have been granted. 
		  As an adult, I crave experiences more than 'things' and hold tightly to heartfelt words rather than a new pair of shoes. For this, my bank account will forever be thankful.

	    <h2>Allow Others To Dictate My Happiness</h2>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<p>There have been so many people who have traveled through in my life, each taking a small piece of me with them. It took moving across the country when I was 21 
		  and making it on my own in a new city to finally figure out the secret to my own happiness and how to make myself whole. Yes, there were mistakes along the way, 
		  but finding out who I was brought about a confidence I never thought possible. From that point on, I was able to allow people to come and go without taking bits of me with them. 
		  I am able to acknowledge others and empathize with their journey without it impacting my own happiness, which is invaluable.

	    <h2>Let My Passion For Learning Diminish</h2>

		  <img alt="Outline drawing of various categories of learning." src="images/learning.jpg" />
		</figure>
		<p>I have always been 'that person'. You know the one. The girl who had perfect attendance and sat in the front of class because she couldn't miss out on learning 
		  something new. There were rare times I was contagious with something and cried my eyes out because I was forced to stay home and missed an assignment (even an exam). 
		  Fast farward to present day and I continue to value continual education. From learning how to code and doing deep dives into history books, there is not a day that goes 
		  by when I am not trying to better myself. Life moves at a whirlwind pace and the opportunities to learn and grow, endless.

	    <h2>Stop Being Adventurous</h2>

		</figure>
		<p>In high school I was an exchange student in Germany and went on another trip to Spain and Morocco. Later in college I picked up a new sport and even partied! 
		OK, I went to one frat party. For twenty minutes...that's neither here nor there - I went! By opening myself up to new adventures, I have grown to be a well-rounded
		individual open to change. Saying 'yes' to every challenge or opportunity is not essential (or easy), but it is a great way to broaden your horizons.

	    <h2>Leave The Toilet Paper Roll Empty</h2>

		<p>Replacing the toilet paper is 100% necessary (over, not under, of course). No one should EVER leave the roll empty! In this instance though, this aims toward a deeper meaning. 
		  From the doing your part to lessen your environmental footprint to holding the door for someone behind you, the message is the same. 
		  If you are always taking from this life and not considering what you are leaving behind or the impact on those around you, you are not doing your part. 
		  I strive to end each day on the right side of the transaction, trying to give more than I take. "Sorry" isn't going to cut it in the end.
